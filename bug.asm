mov eax, [ebx+ecx*4] ;This line is problematic if ecx is a large value that would cause an access violation. 
mov [edi+eax*2],ebx ;This line is also problematic if the value of eax is too large. This may lead to buffer overflow or overwriting other data segments. 
add esp, 4 ; This line may cause stack corruption if the stack pointer is not properly aligned.
